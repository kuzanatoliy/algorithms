# Insertion sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.

### Complexity

| Time (middle/the worst) | Memory (middle/the worst) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| O(n log n)/O(n^2)       | O(log n)/O(n)             |
