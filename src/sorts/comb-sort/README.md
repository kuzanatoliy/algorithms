# Insertion sort

Comb sort is a relatively simple sorting algorithm originally designed by WÅ‚odzimierz Dobosiewicz and Artur Borowy in 1980, later rediscovered (and given the name "Combsort") by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box in 1991. Comb sort improves on bubble sort in the same way that Shellsort improves on insertion sort.

### Complexity

| Time (middle/the worst) | Memory (middle/the worst) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| O(n^2/p^2)/O(n^2)       | O(1)/O(1)                 |
