# Selection sort

In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

### Complexity

| Time (middle/the worst) | Memory (middle/the worst) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| O(n^2)/O(n^2)           | O(1)/O(1)                 |
