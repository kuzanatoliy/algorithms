# Merge sort

Merge is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output.

### Complexity

| Time (middle/the worst) | Memory (middle/the worst) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| O(n log n)/O(n log n)   | O(n)/O(n)                 |
