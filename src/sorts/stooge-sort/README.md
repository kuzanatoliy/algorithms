# Stooge sort

Stooge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm. It is notable for its exceptionally poor time complexity. The algorithm's running time is thus slower compared to reasonable sorting algorithms, and is slower than bubble sort, a canonical example of a fairly inefficient sort. It is, however, more efficient than Slowsort. The name comes from The Three Stooges.

### Complexity

| Time (the worst)       | Memory (the worst) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| O(n ^ log 3 / log 1.5) | O(n)               |
